	abstract = {Strong heat loss and brine release during sea ice formation in coastal polynyas act to cool and salinify waters on the Antarctic continental shelf. Polynya activity thus both limits the ocean heat flux to the Antarctic Ice Sheet and promotes formation of Dense Shelf Water (DSW), the precursor to Antarctic Bottom Water. However, despite the presence of strong polynyas, DSW is not formed on the Sabrina Coast in East Antarctica and in the Amundsen Sea in West Antarctica. Using a simple ocean model driven by observed forcing, we show that freshwater input from basal melt of ice shelves partially offsets the salt flux by sea ice formation in polynyas found in both regions, preventing full-depth convection and formation of DSW. In the absence of deep convection, warm water that reaches the continental shelf in the bottom layer does not lose much heat to the atmosphere and is thus available to drive the rapid basal melt observed at the Totten Ice Shelf on the Sabrina Coast and at the Dotson and Getz ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea. Our results suggest that increased glacial meltwater input in a warming climate will both reduce Antarctic Bottom Water formation and trigger increased mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, with consequences for the global overturning circulation and sea level rise.},

  abstract = {We investigate the sensitivity of the deep meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the Southern Ocean to changes in the easterly wind stress over the Antarctic continental slope. The deep MOC is driven by export of dense Antarctic Bottom Water from the Antarctic continental shelf, and exerts a strong influence on climate by ventilating the deep ocean with oxygen and storing carbon dioxide. The possibility that inter-climatic modifications of the deep overturning may have been driven by changes in the atmospheric circulation has motivated the recent interest in evaluating the sensitivity of the Southern Ocean MOC to modifications of the mid-latitude westerlies. Using a high-resolution eddy-resolving model of a sector of the Southern Ocean, we show that the deep cell of the MOC is highly sensitive to the strength of the polar easterlies, and relatively insensitive to the strength of the mid-latitude westerlies. Our results highlight that determining the deep ocean ventilation in past and future climates demands an accurate evaluation of the concurrent surface wind stress throughout the Southern Ocean.}

  abstract = {Antarctic coastal polynyas are areas of reduced sea ice cover within the ice pack and their associated surface waters are noted for sustaining enhanced levels of biological production during the spring and summer. Here we present satellite-based estimates of interannual changes in the areal extent, phytoplankton abundance, and primary productivity within 37 Antarctic coastal polynya systems over five annual cycles (1997 to 2002). The largest polynya studied was located in the Ross Sea (396,500 km2) while the smallest was located in the West Lazarev Sea (1040 km2). Most polynyas attained maximum areal extents in February of less than 20,000 km2. Mean polynya chlorophyll a from 1 September to 31 March ranged from 0.16 to 2.2 mg m−3, averaging 0.69 mg m−3. Daily production averaged 0.09 to 0.76 g C m−2 d−1. Mean annual primary production ranged from 18 to 161 g C m−2 yr−1, with most coastal polynyas exhibiting annual rates of production between 20 and 80 g C m−2. Total production (the product of the open water area and the spatial mean daily primary production rate) varied by 2 orders of magnitude, from 0.03 to 48 Tg C yr−1. Taken together, the Ross Sea, Ronne Ice Shelf, Prydz Bay, and Amundsen Sea polynyas are responsible for >75% of total polynya production. In eastern Antarctica, where 91% of all Adélie penguin colonies are associated with a coastal polynya, the magnitude of annual production in polynyas explained 65% of the variance in penguin colony size.}
